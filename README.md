# vue-cli-plugin-element-plus
Element Plus plugin for `@vue/cli` 4.5.

### Install

First you need to install `@vue/cli` globally (follow the instructions [here](https://cli.vuejs.org/)).

Then create a project and add the Element Plus plugin:

```bash
vue create my-app
cd my-app
vue add element-plus
```

You'll be asked some questions regarding how Element Plus is configured in your project. After that, you're good to go.

### Use with vue-cli UI

Skip this part if you've done everything in the `Install` section.

If you prefer managing your project in vue-cli UI (by running `vue ui`), here's how you can add Element Plus plugin: go to the Plugins menu, click the upper right `+ Add plugin` button, find `vue-cli-plugin-element-plus` and install it.
